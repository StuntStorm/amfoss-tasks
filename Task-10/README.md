Watching CS50 videos was a peice of cake.

Infact, As I had no background with C language. This was a amazing way to learn, and it did help in the further tasks.

But again when it comes to pset questions it was a bit, *tiny tiny* bit difficult especially the pset question 2 and 4 (althought 4 was easy on it owns but then the method to do it was initially confusing)


So yes, I did get help from the land of wonders (*Google*)  :)
