To build the app in Python using CLI.


I began with importing a package called [Nasa Api](https://pypi.org/project/python-nasa-api/)

And me having perious experience on building on npm packages for JavaScript (You can check it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/~stuntstorm) )
this was really easy to relate
