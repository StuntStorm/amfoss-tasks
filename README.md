## About my tasks

##### Initially I thought It was really going to be super hard. but to be honest, Its well documented (infact,most of the answers are right there in the documents) , and well selected. As in the selection process itself all the important languages are covered which is amazing!. All the tasks I completed was with passion so everytime I get a positive outcome for a problem I have been working for a while. The happiness is remarkable, the relief and satisfaction of it being done is an amazing experience. 70% of the tasks were straight forward and easy to complete but certain task consumed time and info. 

## Who am I?

Hey There ðŸ‘‹,

##### I am N Rizwan from Kerala. I love to go under the alias of StuntStorm, especially while developing games I publish under the name of StuntStorm Production. And I knew about amFoss way before I joined college as my brother was already from Amrita and he used to talk about different clubs and amFoss was one of them. Speaking about my experience in CS Languages I initially used ot make apps (which i never published) back when I was in 7th and then I self taught other languages such as javascript and c# for various projects I worked on. Some of the projects I've worked on is Game Developing (C#) and then developing discord bots (js). And as for hardwares I have worked with Bibox and was part of the Bibox Marine Team. Also have worked with raspberry pi to use it as a server for my discord bots.

##### From all this what I have achieved is that I got to meet lot of talented developers throughout my life especially AAA game devs. And my recent achievement is I was called in for interview Live on Club FM 94.3 because of the games I've developed and I was the first guest after the renovating of club fm.

##### And finally I am a open person and I dont really mind talking to anyone. So if you are wondering to hit me up feel free to :) ```StuntStorm#7231```
